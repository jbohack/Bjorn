## üìÑ Introduction

Bjorn is a powerful tool designed to perform comprehensive network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and data ex-filtration. Its modular design and extensive configuration options allow for flexible and targeted operations. By combining different actions and orchestrating them intelligently, Bjorn can provide valuable insights into network security and help identify and mitigate potential risks.

The e-Paper HAT display and web interface make it easy to monitor and interact with Bjorn, providing real-time updates and status information. With its extensible architecture and customizable actions, Bjorn can be adapted to suit a wide range of security testing and monitoring needs.

## üåü Features

- **Network Scanning**: Identifies live hosts and open ports on the network.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Performs vulnerability scans using Nmap and other tools.
- **System Attacks**: Conducts brute-force attacks on various services (FTP, SSH, SMB, RDP, Telnet, SQL).
- **File Stealing**: Extracts data from vulnerable services.
- **User Interface**: Real-time display on the e-Paper HAT and web interface for monitoring and interaction.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìå Prerequisites

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e775f454-1771-4d6c-bff5-b262b3d98452)

- Raspberry Pi OS installed. 
    - Stable:
      - System: 32-bit
      - Kernel version: 6.6
      - Debian version: 12 (bookworm) '2024-10-22-raspios-bookworm-armhf-lite'
- Username and hostname set to `bjorn`.
- 2.13-inch e-Paper HAT connected to GPIO pins.

At the moment the paper screen v2 & v4 have been tested and implemented.
I juste hope the V1 & V3 will work the same.

### üî® Installation

The fastest way to install Bjorn is using the automatic installation script :

```bash
# Download and run the installer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinition/Bjorn/refs/heads/main/install_bjorn.sh
sudo chmod +x install_bjorn.sh && sudo ./install_bjorn.sh
# Choose the choice 1 for automatic installation. It may take a while as a lot of packages and modules will be installed. You must reboot at the end.
```
